# Slime Area Finder

This is the Java backend for finding the best slime chunk locations in Minecraft.

-----

## How to Run

Here are the general instructions for running the tool locally from your command line.

You'll need **Java** and **Maven** installed.

This command compiles the code and runs `LocalTester.java`:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java
```

This is what runs on my setup. You might need to mess with your own Java environment to get it working. Good luck!
